# CS50-FInance

An application built with Flask that allows users to buy sell and manage stock portfolios. I built this app while taking Harvard's CS50 online course. 


## Running
Start Flask’s built-in web server (within finance/):

`flask run`

Visit the URL outputted by flask to see the distribution code in action. You won’t be able to log in or register, though, just yet!

Via CS50’s file browser, double-click finance.db in order to open it with phpLiteAdmin. Notice how finance.db comes with a table called users. Take a look at its structure (i.e., schema). Notice how, by default, new users will receive $10,000 in cash. But there aren’t (yet!) any users (i.e., rows) therein to browse.

Here on out, if you’d prefer a command line, you’re welcome to use sqlite3 instead of phpLiteAdmin.
